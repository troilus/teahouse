## 1. Design direction

Teahouse uses the familiar structure of a stable desktop messenger, with restrained material, spacing, and feedback principles inspired by Apple platform design.

- **One accent:** tea green `#3D8B6B` for primary actions, selected states, and local-message tint. Other surfaces use neutral gray/green values.
- **System typography:** PingFang SC, Microsoft YaHei, and Noto Sans CJK fallbacks; 14px body text.
- **Project-owned line icons:** 1.6px rounded strokes, current-color inheritance, and no emoji as system controls.
- **Local cross-platform emoji:** bundled Twemoji SVG subsets support Windows 7 and UOS without a color emoji font. Clipboard and protocol retain original UTF-8 characters.
- **Unified brand:** the teacup speech-bubble image family supplies package, window, app, and tray assets. macOS menu bar uses a monochrome template.
- **Restrained motion:** 150–220ms easing, immediate pointer-down scale around 0.97–0.98, no decorative loops, and a reduced-motion path.
- **Purposeful material:** structural panes use lightweight surfaces and borders. Blur is reserved for actual overlays and is disabled in software-rendered Windows/Linux profiles.
- **Consistent shape scale:** 8–10px controls, 12–16px cards/panels, and 999px pills.
- **Token discipline:** every color, type size, radius, shadow, and motion value comes from `styles/tokens.css`.

Naive UI 2.43.2 provides standard form, search, and common action primitives through centralized Teahouse theme overrides. Navigation, chat bubbles, media/file/game cards, capture, image viewing, brand, and specialized cabinet interactions remain project components.

## 2. Main window

```text
┌────────┬────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Rail   │ List                   │ Content                          │
│ 68 px  │ 272 px                 │ flexible, at least 560 px        │
│        │                        │                                  │
│ avatar │ search / section       │ chat / contact / cabinet         │
│ chat   │ conversations/contacts │ header and primary content       │
│ people │                        │                                  │
│        │                        │                                  │
│ cabinet / refresh / settings    │ composer or cabinet action bar   │
└────────┴────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┘
```

The minimum window is 960×640 and restores its previous size and position. The main Naive UI provider uses abstract mode so `.shell` retains a complete 100% height chain at default, minimum, maximized, and restored sizes.

### 2.1 Navigation rail

- Fixed 68px neutral surface with a subtle divider.
- Top identity avatar opens profile editing; main entries switch Chat and Contacts.
- Bottom tools, top to bottom: File Cabinet, global peer refresh, Settings.
- Main icons are 25px and lower tools 21px. Selected/hover state uses tea green.
- File Cabinet switches the existing main window to its third tab and remains available before a shared directory is configured.
- Global refresh is enabled only when a scan range exists. Every activation opens a centered confirmation with an amber warning icon, range count/list, Cancel, and Start scan. During scanning, the action is disabled and shows a conic progress ring.
- Icon tooltips appear only after real pointer movement and a short delay. They do not use native `title`, arrows, or translation motion.
- Hovering the local avatar for 120ms opens one profile card connected through an invisible pointer bridge. The card prioritizes avatar/nickname, local IPv4, organization/device rows, and a low-emphasis Node ID footer.

### 2.2 Frameless desktop behavior

Main and Settings windows use an immersive frameless layout. macOS keeps native traffic-light controls; Windows/Linux draw minimize, maximize/restore, and close controls. A 32px top drag region supports dragging and double-click maximize/restore. Linux uses a JavaScript drag implementation where CSS drag regions are unreliable.

Global overlays sit above the drag region. Settings is modal relative to the main window on Windows/Linux, with a static dim scrim and a visible 1px window inset for weak compositor shadows. macOS uses its native shadow without the main-window scrim.

## 3. Conversation list

Decision #301 / OPT-29: use the existing secondary-text token locally for conversation timestamps, previews, counts and placeholders; contact counts, IPs, offline names and placeholders; search section labels, summaries, organization paths, offline labels and status messages. Preserve primary online text, gray offline avatars/status dots, disabled controls, global tokens, typography, geometry and page zoom.

Each row shows avatar and online dot, display name, latest-message summary, timestamp, and unread badge. Muted unread badges are gray. Pinned conversations appear first on a separate subtle background; remaining rows sort by latest message time.

The selected row uses a weak tea-green material and a 3px inset accent line. Preview text stays secondary. Summaries avoid revealing game outcomes and use semantic labels such as `[Image]`, `[File]`, or `[PK]`.

The context menu includes Pin, Mute, and Remove conversation. Removal opens a confirmation that explains history deletion. Confirmation removes the row immediately and displays a bottom-centered ten-second Undo capsule; expiry commits deletion of messages, FTS entries, and the conversation record.

The list `+` opens discussion-group creation with searchable multi-selection.

Decision #294: measure the context menu after rendering and clamp it within an 8px CSS viewport margin. Reposition while open on resize. Keep existing `webContents` page zoom, menu actions, and Escape priority.

## 4. Contacts

Global-search buttons explicitly stretch their column content; filenames have their own truncating text span so long names and summaries keep ellipses without horizontal overflow.

Decision #302 / OPT-30: conversation, contact/group and global-search rows use native type=button actions. Tab focuses; Enter/Space invoke the existing single-click action. Contacts show the profile, whose existing Send message button opens chat; mouse double-click still opens chat directly. Expose group expanded state, current conversation, and contact names including presence/IP. A local 2px tea-green inset focus-visible outline preserves layout and selection styling. Keep context menus, Escape, font inheritance, truncation, reduced motion and IME/platform behavior; no additional global keyboard listeners.

```text
Discussion groups
Company (online/total)
  Department
    Team
      ● Online peer
      ○ Offline peer
Ungrouped
```

- Company, department, and team are collapsible; empty levels are skipped.
- Online peers sort first. Offline peers retain their row, use gray avatar/text, and show a gray status dot.
- A persistent search filters notes, nickname, organization, IP, and other contexts defined by requirements.
- A single click opens the complete contact profile in the content pane. It includes avatar, note/display name, status, organization, IP, hostname, platform, last-seen time, local-note editing, and a Send message action.
- A double click opens the private chat and triggers the secondary liveness probe.
- Discussion groups occupy a fixed section above organization trees.
- The paused compatibility mode reserves a separate Neiwangtong section and simplified profile; it does not mix compatibility peers into the Teahouse organization tree.

## 5. Chat content

### 5.1 Header

Private chat shows avatar/status dot, display name, and a complete single-line `status · IP` subtitle. Clicking the identity area opens a compact profile popover and note editor. Hover changes only the name color; the full hit target and keyboard focus ring remain.

Group chat shows a circular group avatar, name, and member count. The 84px chat header aligns with the list header: 32px drag space plus 52px content.

The right side contains conversation options. A group member count opens an overlay panel that covers the right side without resizing the message column. Private chat adds a File Cabinet button before the options menu. It is disabled with a specific tooltip when the peer is offline, unsupported, unshared, or denies access.

### 5.2 Messages

- Peer and local text bubbles use 14px corners and token colors. Local bubbles use a light tea-green tint.
- **Selection alignment and gesture cursor (#305):** calibrate native highlight dimensions and offsets against the OCR line bounds. A non-Shift text pointerdown clears the previous local selection before native caret placement, preventing text drag-and-drop while preserving Shift extension and double-click word selection. Dragging from text keeps a text cursor across line gaps and image blank areas until pointer release/cancel, blur or layer cleanup. Blank-area drags still pan.
- **In-image OCR (#304, superseding the separate result panel):** Recognize Text is manual on every platform and changes to Cancel while working. Completed or cached results use one transparent native text node per detected line, with a visible selection highlight; drag text to select partial/cross-line content and drag blank areas to pan. The layer follows image transforms. Support Ctrl/Cmd+C, Copy Selection (preserving the selection on pointerdown) and Copy All. Escape clears a text selection before closing the viewer. The OCR button toggles the completed text layer; image changes clear it and cancel active work. No separate text dialog.
- **Image navigation (#303):** center a 44px native Previous/Next chevron button on each side of the dark image canvas, using existing tokens and visible keyboard focus. Browse the complete local conversation history, with disabled endpoints and no wrap. Disable buttons while querying; show failures with retry while retaining the current image. Switching fits the new image inside the existing window, resets transforms/OCR display, and preserves window bounds and existing arrow-key panning. Buttons are separate from the drag stage and text layer.
- Images load bounded thumbnails near the viewport and open a validated original in Image Viewer.
- File cards show name, size, state, expiry, progress, and relevant receive/save/direct/cancel/resume actions.
- System rows remain low-emphasis and support the explicit cabinet-upload open-directory action.
- Emoji and stickers use local assets and lazy asynchronous decoding. The sticker tab offers a native multi-image import action, keeps square rows non-overlapping with vertical overflow, and enables sending in group conversations when at least one other member is online.
- Game bubbles reveal results only after local animation; notifications, list summaries, and search do not expose a hidden result early.
- Right-click menus provide context-appropriate copy, forward, recall, save, sticker, and other actions. Recall stays one row with a right-aligned monospaced countdown/reason; danger color intensifies during the final ten seconds.

The message area preserves a conversation's scroll position. Entry from notification, tray, nudge, or a newly opened conversation loads the latest page and scrolls to the bottom. A visible, focused current conversation may immediately mark an incoming message read; background, minimized, tray-hidden, or unfocused states retain unread status until focus returns.

### 5.3 Composer

The composer provides emoji, capture, image, file, and folder actions. It supports paste/drag/drop, draft persistence, Enter or Ctrl/Cmd+Enter sending, IME composition protection, dynamic height, and disabled/offline feedback.

Capture startup failures are never silent. When the main window was visible, it returns with a dismissible seven-second top-center status containing a warning icon, an explicit reason/fallback, `role=status`, and `aria-live=assertive`. A shortcut invoked from an already hidden window uses a system notification when available and reveals the app only as a fallback. Empty sources/images, hide failures, and exceptions all direct users to system capture plus chat-box `Ctrl+V` when built-in capture remains unavailable.

On ARM64 Wayland, Electron 22 screen enumeration is bypassed before the main window hides, so capture immediately uses that visible system-capture + `Ctrl+V` fallback instead of risking a native process crash. x64 Wayland, ARM64 X11, and other platforms retain the existing flow.

Table paste inserts text into the draft and shows a compact hint with Send as image and Ignore. Pressing the configured send key sends plain text. The hint disappears after draft or conversation changes. Oversized drafts keep a persistent explanatory error.

Windows 7 uses a system-font `contenteditable` composer with non-editable 1.3em Twemoji atoms to preserve Sogou IME candidate positioning. Other platforms use the textarea plus `PantryEmojiBlank` mirror path. Both routes preserve UTF-16 selection mapping and ignore send-key behavior while composition is active.

### 5.4 In-chat file cabinet panel

The private-chat cabinet panel overlays a 320px right column and can coexist with the conversation. It contains:

1. peer avatar/name, current permission badge, Open in File Cabinet, and Close;
2. parent/back, breadcrumb, and refresh controls;
3. compact 36px list rows with single-click selection and double-click folder navigation;
4. in-place progress and permission-specific download/upload actions;
5. persistent destination guidance.

It uses the same keyboard and context-menu semantics as the full cabinet tab. Opening one right-side panel closes any conflicting group/profile panel.

## 6. Search

Global search groups results into contacts, discussion groups, chat messages, and files. Results prefer local notes, show circular avatars and offline state, and jump to the relevant chat/message/file location.

Conversation history search opens a large focused panel from the composer toolbar. It defaults to recent records and supports text, image, file, and continuous date-range filters. Image results show thumbnails. Selecting a result restores the conversation and highlights the target message.

Search inputs debounce requests by 200ms and preserve keyboard focus/escape behavior. Global search shows the existing placeholder style while loading or after failure, with retry on new input. Query changes and unmount clear pending timers and invalidate older responses (decision #295).

## 7. Key flows

### 7.1 Create or manage a discussion group

Open the creation flow from the conversation list or add members from a private/group context. Search and select contacts, enter a name, optionally set management credentials, then submit once. Submission locks dismissal; a failed IPC restores controls and shows an inline error. The member panel exposes role-specific invite, remove, rename, owner/admin, avatar, and leave actions.

Group descriptions and announcements appear below the avatar in the member panel and take no space while empty. Owners, administrators, and password-authorized members edit either field through one shared Teleport modal. Description length is capped at 200 characters and announcement length at 1,024; saving an empty value clears existing content. Password members reuse the panel password input and inline error. The modal supports backdrop, Cancel, Escape, initial textarea focus, focus restoration, and a locked busy state.

### 7.2 Receive a file

An ordinary offer creates a file card with Receive and Save as. Default receive and private direct-send use `save directory/contact name/`; Save as uses the selected directory directly. Transfer progress remains on the card. A receiver cancellation keeps resume state when supported. Expiry removes receive/resume actions and gives each side an explicit terminal label.

### 7.3 Tray and notifications

Clicking a notification opens the exact conversation. Tray unread attention uses platform-appropriate icons/badges. Notifications respect focus/visibility, mute, content privacy, mentions, and nudge rules. Linux/Windows use a local app icon.

### 7.4 First launch

The setup flow collects the minimum required local identity and makes device-as-identity semantics clear. It uses the same brand and form tokens as Settings and never requests an Internet account.

### 7.5 Offline messages

Sending to an offline peer creates a waiting state. Automatic retry preserves ordering when presence returns. The UI never shows delivered until ACK succeeds.

### 7.6 Peer update

About shows a compact LAN Update row with status, help tooltip, and action. It searches online peers only, requests a package only after explicit action, and does not claim installation completion. Explanatory text stays in the accessible custom tooltip to keep the card compact.

### 7.7 Shared file cabinet

Open your cabinet from the navigation rail, or another peer's cabinet from the peer list/private chat. Permission, offline state, failures, selection, transfer progress, and destination guidance remain in the current cabinet surface without adding chat media entries.

<a id="remote-view"></a>

### 7.8 Remote desktop viewing (#310, v0.58.0)

Scope follows [requirements](requirements.md#remote-view). Use an independent non-modal window with explicit per-session screen selection; main-window chat remains usable. The canonical Chinese UI section is §7.9.

#### Invitation and consent

- Add “View screen” to the private-chat header; omit it from groups. Hide it for legacy peers without `rv1`; disable with a specific reason for unavailable roles, offline peers, or busy sessions. Keep gray + “Offline” text rather than color alone.
- Clicking first opens the explanation and target confirmation; no request IPC, network traffic or card occurs before Send request. Repeated clicks on an existing session locate it without creating a new request. Each request is a local system card updated through its lifecycle, without unread increments. Changing chats never retargets the session.
- The sharer sees the viewer's local contact display name and IP, an explanation of view-only access to the selected screen, and “Choose screen” / “Decline”. Receipt alone does not enumerate or capture.
- Entering selection displays local screen thumbnails/names; the user selects a screen and explicitly starts sharing. Never silently accept the primary display. Show permission denial/cancel/failure; system dialogs remain inside the request deadline.
- Open the always-on-top consent window with `showInactive`, including when main is hidden. Keep typing focus where it is; opening consent never starts capture. Duplicate/rate-limited invitations do not open another window.

#### Viewing and persistent sharing status

| Role | Presentation and behavior |
|---|---|
| Viewer | Independent resizable, non-modal window titled Screen assistance, with peer name and IP in the toolbar. Proportional image, fit, received-pixel 100%, local pan/scroll, and End. Fit initial bounds to the work area and permit maximize. No input forwarding, OCR, saving, or recording controls. |
| Sharer | A 320×56 DIP always-on-top strip at the selected screen work-area edge, showing sharing status, viewer and Stop; full peer/IP/source details are available as a tooltip. Show connecting before active. Do not steal typing focus; do not allow minimizing away the stop entry. Close stops sharing, while chat remains usable. |

The local sharing indicator may appear in transmitted images; do not promise cross-platform window exclusion. Validate source-pointer capture and never present the viewer's pointer as the sharer's operation position.

Hiding main or selecting a different chat leaves a separate session running. Minimized viewers keep low-rate reception. Closing the assistance window or End/Stop ends immediately without another confirmation. Escape respects IME and native select interaction; elsewhere it ends the session, instead of applying the main window's hide-to-tray shortcut.

**Smoothness selector:** Auto (default), Economy (3 fps), Standard (5 fps), and Smooth (10 fps). Show “Target: N fps” separately, never as measured throughput. Changes affect subsequent requests without reconnecting; all modes share quality. Reset to Auto for each new session. A minimized viewer temporarily uses a 3 fps target.

#### State feedback and accessibility

| State | Visible feedback |
|---|---|
| requesting / awaiting-consent | Waiting for consent / incoming request, with cancel or decline |
| preparing | Preparing screen, system permission may be required; cancel available |
| connecting | Consent received, connecting; show an empty waiting area |
| active | Live image on viewer; named viewer and persistent stop on sharer |
| No refreshed frame for 2 seconds | Explicit stale-image message above the image until a new frame; terminate at protocol deadline |
| ended | Destroy the assistance window and image; retain the localized outcome and local request/start/end/duration in the corresponding chat card. A new request requires confirmation and new consent. |

Keep tokens, sequence numbers, wire fields, and stack traces out of user flows. Announce meaningful state changes accessibly without announcing every frame. Use labeled native buttons, Tab/Enter/Space, native-window focus order for consent, and IME/consumed-event-aware Escape. Reuse visual tokens and reduced-motion behavior; locally validate Chinese/English and minimum sizes; validate high DPI on target machines.

## 8. Settings and file cabinet

### 8.1 Settings

Settings is a 640×480 frameless window with a direct left navigation: Profile, General, Notifications, Chat & Files, Network, Shortcuts, and About. Each row has an 18px project line icon. The sidebar does not repeat avatar/nickname summary content.

| Section | Current controls |
|---|---|
| Profile | Avatar mode/crop, nickname, company, department, team |
| General | Auto-start, close behavior, light/dark segmented control, 100/110/125% font zoom |
| Notifications | System notification, message-content privacy, optional sound |
| Chat & Files | Save directory, allow direct private files, Open File Cabinet guidance, send-key control, export/import, transfer records |
| Network | Manual peers, CIDR ranges, per-range refresh/remove, confirmed UDP/TCP port editing, paused compatibility placeholders |
| Shortcuts | Record-style capture and show/hide bindings, conflict error, restore defaults, hide app during capture |
| About | Brand/trust statement, version, GPL license, source link, LAN update status/action, expandable runtime and attribution details |

Profile, theme, and send-key choices share one segmented-control structure. Avatar cropping uses a global circular preview, drag, multiplicative zoom, reset, bounded high-quality 192×192 WebP output, validation errors, focus restoration, and reduced-motion behavior.

Port inputs stay read-only until a modal explains that discovery, messaging, and file transfer require matching configurations and firewall policy. Confirmation unlocks one field, focuses/selects it, validates 1–65535 on blur, then relocks it.

### 8.2 File Cabinet tab

The third main-window tab replaces the list and content columns while preserving the rail.

**List column:** a My File Cabinet summary card plus searchable colleagues whose profiles advertise `shr1`. Peers sort online first; offline and old/unsupported entries remain selectable and show an explanatory content state.

**Browser content:**

- 52px peer header under a 32px drag strip, permission badge, list/grid control, refresh;
- 40px breadcrumb row;
- 28px details header;
- 40px list rows or an adaptive five-column grid;
- bottom selection summary, Save as, Upload, Download, destination explanation, and in-place progress.

Desktop file-manager semantics apply: single-click select, double-click enter, Ctrl/Cmd toggle, Shift range, arrows, Space, Enter, Backspace/Cmd+Up, F5/Cmd+R, Ctrl/Cmd+A for loaded entries, and Escape clear. The context menu contains Download, Save as, and Copy filename. Delete, rename, remote overwrite, thumbnails, and client-side sorting are intentionally absent.

**My File Cabinet:** configure/open/change/stop the shared root, choose default Off/Read/Read+Upload, manage per-peer exceptions, and review the ten most recent completed incoming uploads. All changes save immediately. Invalid roots show a local inline reason.

**States:** setup guidance, empty folder, offline/unsupported/denied, first-page retry, load-more row retry that preserves loaded entries, a 5,000-entry truncation note, drag upload guidance, and explicit permission/destination explanations.

## 9. Visual tokens

| Token | Value or role |
|---|---|
| `--primary` | `#3D8B6B` tea green |
| `--text-1/2/3` | `#17211C` / `#58645E` / `#87918C` |
| `--text-placeholder` | `#B8B8B8` |
| `--bg-window/list/chat` | `#F9FBFA` / `#F1F5F3` / `#EDF2EF` |
| `--bubble-peer/mine` | white / 12% primary |
| `--line` | `rgba(40, 66, 53, 0.10)` |
| `--material-bar/panel/strong` | theme-specific structural surfaces |
| `--scrim` | theme-specific translucent modal backdrop |
| `--surface-hover/selected` | neutral 5% / tea green 12% |
| `--online/offline` | `#2BA245` / `#C2C2C2` |
| `--danger/badge` | `#E5484D` / `#FA5151` |
| `--font-xs/sm/md/lg` | 12 / 13 / 14 / 16px |
| Spacing | multiples of 4px |
| `--radius-control/panel/pill` | 8 / 12 / 999px |

Circular avatars, local line icons, file-type artwork, tray graphics, and brand art remain consistent across light/dark surfaces and supported operating systems.

## 10. Change record

- **2026-09-16, v1.91, #308, documentation only:** record invitation, per-session selection/consent, persistent stop feedback, state/termination flows, and the proposed separate viewer. Presentation is pending; application **v0.57.0** has no such entry yet.

- **2026-09-16, proposal supplement:** describe Auto/Economy/Standard/Smooth selection, pending confirmation of default/persistence behavior. No implementation.
- **2026-08-10, v1.75, decision #285:** added the maintained English current-state UI and interaction reference plus bidirectional language navigation. Product UI language and runtime behavior remain unchanged. Repository version 0.51.0 → 0.51.1.
- **2026-08-26, v1.76, decision #286:** made capture startup failures visible through a dismissible, accessible in-app status or a system notification when the app was already hidden; Linux capture now waits for window hiding and compositor settling to avoid including the app. Repository version 0.51.1 → 0.51.2.
- **2026-08-27, v1.77, decision #287:** added an accessible sticker-import action with progress/result feedback, sized four-column sticker rows to their square items inside the fixed 200px scrolling region, and enabled saved stickers in groups when another member is online. Repository version 0.51.2 → 0.52.0.
- **2026-08-29, v1.78, decision #289:** ARM64 Wayland capture now uses the existing visible system-capture paste fallback before Electron 22 native screen enumeration and before hiding the main window. Other platform flows are unchanged. Repository version 0.53.0 → 0.53.1.
- **2026-08-31, v1.79, decision #290:** added member-panel display, edit, and clear flows for group descriptions and announcements. Both fields share one accessible Teleport text modal and the existing password-aware management path; successful saves refresh the group view immediately, while failures preserve input and show inline feedback. Repository version 0.53.1 → **0.54.0**.
- **2026-09-05, v1.80, decision #291:** PR #39 review fixes use one `GroupTextDialog`. Ordinary members reuse the group panel's existing management password when saving either field; success refreshes the group view, failure preserves input, and switching dialogs clears stale feedback. Typography, radii, and the scrim use existing tokens. Repository version 0.54.0 → **0.54.1**.
- **2026-09-05, v1.81, decision #293:** plain Escape hides only the main window. IME composition, modifiers, repeats, consumed events, dialogs, menus, and cabinet selection take precedence. First-run setup and an open settings window block hiding; use minimize if the tray is unavailable. Close preferences and global shortcuts remain intact. Repository version 0.54.2 → **0.54.3**.
- **2026-09-05, v1.82, decision #294:** keep the measured conversation menu inside the viewport through resize and existing page zoom. Repository version 0.54.3 → **0.54.4**.
- **2026-09-05, v1.83, decision #295:** isolate stale global-search responses and provide loading/failure feedback. Repository version 0.54.4 → **0.54.5**.
- **2026-09-05, v1.84, decision #301:** improve list metadata readability using the existing secondary token locally, preserving offline semantics, disabled controls, global tokens and geometry. Version **0.54.10 → 0.54.11**.
- **2026-09-05, v1.85, decision #302:** native list buttons add Tab/Enter/Space and local inset focus indicators, with expanded/current/presence semantics and existing mouse/IME/platform behavior. Version **0.54.11 → 0.54.12**.

- **2026-09-06, v1.86, decision #303:** add canvas-side conversation image navigation, disabled endpoints, request/error feedback and stable window bounds. Version **0.54.12 → 0.55.0**.

- **2026-09-06, v1.87, decision #304:** replace the separate OCR result panel with in-image native text selection, manual/cancellable recognition and cache restoration. Version **0.55.0 → 0.56.0**.

- **2026-09-06, v1.88, decision #305:** fix selection-box alignment and cross-line gesture cursor flicker. Version **0.56.0 → 0.56.1**.

- **2026-09-07, decision #306, v0.56.2:** built-in emoji retain transparent Unicode text beneath local SVGs for native selection/copy without extra line breaks; whole-message copy retains original text. The Win7 editor copies/cuts its existing logical draft selection. Linux text inputs use native insertText only for explicit NumLock-on Numpad digits or matching navigation keys, without modifiers or composition; consume events only on successful insertion. Readonly/disabled fields, NumLock-off navigation, Windows and macOS keep native behavior. No protocol, schema, IPC or dependency changes. UOS native event-chain verification remains a target-platform check.

## Decision #307: Language selection

General settings and onboarding expose “语言 / Language” with “简体中文” and “English”. Changes apply to open windows without losing input. Localize Naive UI, accessibility labels, prompts, tray and notifications; check long English labels at minimum sizes. User content stays verbatim. Native operating-system dialogs and installer chrome follow their own language settings.

- 2026-09-16, decision #310: v0.58.0 implements view-only remote assistance, independent windows, Auto (10/5/3 fps) and manual Economy/Standard/Smooth modes. Consent, one-frame backpressure, bounded deadlines, lock detection and forced window cleanup are covered by local tests. Physical target-platform permission and performance checks remain pending; this iteration is not a release.

## Earlier assistance UI review (#311, superseded by #312 for sharing window size)

Use the existing Teahouse tokens, native controls and window frame. Compact identity/rate/zoom controls leave more space for the image; narrow windows wrap controls without clipping Stop. Pending requests say Cancel. Source thumbnails scroll independently above a fixed Decline / Choose / Share action row, with visible keyboard focus and preparation feedback. The sharing window contracts to approximately 440×180 content pixels after consent, remains movable and always on top, and shows peer identity, IP, source and Stop. Long labels truncate with full tooltips. Place it on the main window display and keep resizing inside the current work area. Reuse IME-aware Escape handling including keyCode 229. No blur, continuous animation or new icon dependency.

- 2026-09-17, v1.94, #311: compact assistance UI and fixed source actions; application **0.58.1**.

## Assistance interaction refinement (#312)

Decision #312 (v0.59.0) supersedes the 440×180 sharing status: use the same opaque, frameless sharing window as a 320×56 DIP strip at the selected display work-area top-right edge. Keep identity/status and Stop visible, allow dragging, disable resizing/maximizing/minimizing after consent, and re-anchor on display metrics changes. Consent retains source selection and fixed actions. Viewers keep native frames. The initiator first sees target name/IP, view-only and consent explanation, Cancel and Send request; focus starts on Cancel, Tab stays in the dialog, IME-aware Escape cancels, and no IPC/request/history occurs before confirmation. One restrained chat card per request shows its local lifecycle, request/start/end times and actual connected duration; refusal wording respects the local role. No blur or continuous animations.

The confirmation uses the Chrome 108 native dialog focus scope. Global Escape handling recognizes open native dialogs; the dialog explicitly centers itself, and backdrop scrim tokens are defined on the pseudo-element because this Chromium baseline does not inherit root variables there.

- 2026-09-17, v1.96, #313, application **0.59.1**: place self-initiated assistance cards on the right and peer-initiated cards on the left, using the ordinary message row spacing and width constraint, capped at 340px. Status updates and history reload preserve direction. Omit delivery ticks for these lifecycle records; time separators and other system notices remain centered.

- 2026-09-17, v1.97, #314, application **0.59.2**: reuse one initiator-aligned card through request, start and end. Cap width at 260px and use ordinary mine/peer bubble colors. Two compact lines show icon/name/current status, then request time (start time once connected) and completed duration; other stages show View only. Target about 64px height at default font size, allowing wrapping for long dates, translations or enlarged text. Full request/start/end times, duration and reason remain in native hover and accessible text. Remove direction prose, the timing table and normal-session banner; keep request-failure feedback. No ticking timers or continuous animation.

## Diagnostics and feedback (#315)

Keep the seven navigation groups. Add a compact section under About, with Export diagnostics as the primary action and Copy environment info as secondary. Explain local-only export and excluded chat/file content. An unchecked Include real network addresses option applies to this window only; copied information always stays redacted. Use a native save dialog, a disabled busy action, inline accessible success/error feedback and Reveal in folder after success. Cancellation is silent. Ask for occurrence time and steps, and bundles from both sides for transfer problems. Reuse theme tokens; wrap and scroll at 640×480, without effects or a live dashboard.

- 2026-09-17: Decision #315, application **0.60.0**; diagnostics design recorded before implementation.
