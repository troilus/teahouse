# Teahouse documentation

> [简体中文](../README.md) · **English**

The established Simplified Chinese documents are the canonical product, protocol, UI, and engineering records. The English set is a maintained current-state translation. A change to documented behavior must update both languages in one commit and pass `npm run check:docs`.

| [Technical design](tech-design.md) | Architecture, storage, risks, tests, and CI | [技术设计](../tech-design.md) |
| [End-to-end encryption](e2e-encryption.md) | Local E2E extension: design, threat model, troubleshooting | [端到端加密](../e2e-encryption.md) |

Historical implementation plans remain Chinese engineering records. Local target-platform packaging notes remain private under the repository's existing ignore policy.
